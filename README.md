# LeisureSphere

This project is my realization of the [final project of TOP's Rails path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project).

For deployment [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) was used and the PostgreSQL database is run via [Neon](https://neon.com/), so you can [try the app yourself](https://leisuresphere-19144872.koyeb.app/).

## Features

     After completing one of those actions they are redirected back to the post on the Feed or the profile page (depending on where they took their action).

- Miscellaneous
  - After signing up users receive a Welcome email (as email provider [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us) was used).
  - Image upload is realized via Active storage using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) for cloud storage.
  - Stimulus controller toggling the "post options" button on the profile page where users can update or delete their posts.
  - This application has 98.63% test coverage. The tests were implemented using RSpec, Capybara and FactoryBots.
 
  (Please note: Although some CSS was added to create an appealing appearance, no effort was made towards a responsive design as the focus was on applying my Rails knowledge and learning new aspects about Rails.)
